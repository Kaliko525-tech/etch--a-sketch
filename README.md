I need to make a 16x16 grid, I have found a answer to how to do that on stackoverflow,which I will implemnt to do it. it looks to work fine and I understand how it works. So I see no problem with using it as I didn't know how to do it, so I googled how to do it and found an answer. 

first attempt didn't work, decided to use the knowledge I have obtained to just create my onw grid, I got them to show up on the screen, so that's good. My math is correct but the look is wrong, I have solid blocks at the moment. I think I need to change the center somehow...padding? 

padding is what I wanted, but now I have rectangles not squares. hmm...

figured out how to do it. I now have a 16x16 grid of squares. it's in the top left corner though. one step at a time. 

i discovered a cool new way to get it right with flexbox, but it feels 'hardcoded' , like I can't change it on the fly. I will figure sometihing out though. To make it more flexible. I feel like I should be doing it in JS. But we can leave it for now. Take the steps I need to make it more dynamic later with some more research in the matter later on.

there is a way to make it more dynamic that I will implement now, hopefully it works.

I copied the new dynamic function for creating box grids, I chose this over the old function because it felt too hard coded and didn't allow for the grid to be easily changed. I'm bummed I didn't think of this myself but it did teach me a lot. I now know a new and dynamic way to make a grid box with any desired amount of boxes, it will also keep it as a box. I don't 100% understand all the code that I copied but to be fair it's only one thing, like I don't understand why for  total we are squaring the number (YxY) and then adding the number one for time. the rest I understand. I even know what pound sign in CSS is used for now and it's pretty cool. 

on to step 2 now
