I need to make a 16x16 grid, I have found a answer to how to do that on stackoverflow,which I will implemnt to do it. it looks to work fine and I understand how it works. So I see no problem with using it as I didn't know how to do it, so I googled how to do it and found an answer. 

first attempt didn't work, decided to use the knowledge I have obtained to just create my onw grid, I got them to show up on the screen, so that's good. My math is correct but the look is wrong, I have solid blocks at the moment. I think I need to change the center somehow...padding?
