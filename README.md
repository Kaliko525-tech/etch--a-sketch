started over.

I was just not getting the results I wanted with the stack overflow searches, so I just started over clean and I have managed to re-do the first step in creating a 16x16 grid. The researched asnwers helped me to work out what direction I needed to take in orde to create it. 

I went with a simple fucntion that takes a single arguement to create the amount of div's needed to create a grid at the users desired size. I then proceeded to play around with the CSS to get the desired look and figure out what I need to change specifically to keep the grid the same height and width but change the size of the boxes to fit inside the container. 

This is all very hard coded for now, but I now have an idea of what needs to be changed in order to create a more dynamic page at a later stage, I think I may even make the change more dynamic first before moving on to find out how I make the boxes change colour as you hover over it, as that seems to be the part I am struggling with the most at this point in time.
