I need to make a 16x16 grid, I have found a answer to how to do that on stackoverflow,which I will implemnt to do it. it looks to work fine and I understand how it works. So I see no problem with using it as I didn't know how to do it, so I googled how to do it and found an answer. 

first attempt didn't work, decided to use the knowledge I have obtained to just create my onw grid, I got them to show up on the screen, so that's good. My math is correct but the look is wrong, I have solid blocks at the moment. I think I need to change the center somehow...padding? 

padding is what I wanted, but now I have rectangles not squares. hmm...

figured out how to do it. I now have a 16x16 grid of squares. it's in the top left corner though. one step at a time. 

i discovered a cool new way to get it right with flexbox, but it feels 'hardcoded' , like I can't change it on the fly. I will figure sometihing out though. To make it more flexible. I feel like I should be doing it in JS. But we can leave it for now. Take the steps I need to make it more dynamic later with some more research in the matter later on.
